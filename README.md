# DLSU CCS Year 1 Term 1 Machine Project - Harvest Sun
- This program is a strategic game called "HarvestSun", where you try to survive living in a farm land where unexpected calamities happen. You have the options to farm, shop (buy and sell), and to go home for the next day. Balancing resources is the key! Look out for "calamities" that challenges your very own tenacity. Play now and see what you're made of.

- work done in Neovim 

## Learning Outcomes:
- Done in pure C procedural, first time working with pointers manually
- Pass by value and pass by reference importance
- cannot use return to terminate prematurely, so used a "flag" with a mix of if else magic
  - however this hack or workaround made the code messy
- naming things is hard
